      <description>When building a policy that contains multiple metric conditions, users can now use the Match Conditions feature to toggle between validating all of the conditions listed or just any one condition provided. Previously, policies with multiple metric conditions only fired when all listed conditions were met.
How Policies Fire Using All vs Any:
 All: Policy only fires an alert when all metric conditions are met Any: Policy fires an alert when at least one metric condition is met  Note that this Match Conditions feature is only available with metric conditions, and is found in the conditions tab in the Policy Editor.</description>
