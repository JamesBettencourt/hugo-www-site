After several months getting settled into my role as Chief Data Scientist for Netuitive, I have focused on learning the product's capabilities and limits and have been struck by the depth of intelligence and automation that have been built during nearly 20 years of cumulative R&D.

I've especially enjoyed getting to know our customers, who are some of the world's most progressive banks, telcos, and retail payments organizations that are at the forefront for their ability to monitor critical application performance across silos and in increasingly virtualized environments. These are businesses that must be able to understand the business impact of IT as it relates to their large, revenue and customer facing applications and services.

For several years these large organizations have experimented and are now successfully deploying advanced IT analytics solutions. Now we are starting to see broader enterprise interest in solving monitoring and performance management challenges as they relate to critical revenue facing services in this new world order of virtualization. These organizations are all attempting to deal with exponential increases in the volume, variety, and velocity of data requiring analysis.

The proof is all around us. Look no further than Gartner forecasts of 100% growth in spending on IT Operations Analytics over the next few years. We are seeing this in the form of enterprises with rapidly expanding critical revenue lines tied to online business and services. As Black Friday and Cyber Monday loom, once again these organizations are scrambling to ensure they are able to maximize IT and application performance at peak loads while also seeking to proactively identify anomalies that might cascade into more serious service issues impacting revenue.

Netuitive's IT analytics are at the heart of this challenge and I am excited about the possibilities as we are working with a growing number of large and mid-size enterprises who are now coming to us for solutions.

And while the product is already highly advanced, incorporating nine patented technologies, it is also my responsibility to evaluate and align product enhancements with Netuitive's business model and roadmap for growth. This includes expanding the company's portfolio of algorithms to support applications of different types across multiple industry sectors.

To that end, we have determined key next steps for Netuitive's technology advancement including the filing of a new provisional patent with the US Patent Office. It's called the Managed Element Health Graphical User Interface, or ME Health, and will make it easier for users to proactively manage services, reduce mean time to repair (MTTR), and eliminate down time for large scale, revenue-impacting applications and services.

Following this are two more patents on the board. One involves a new family of analytics that are particularly useful for business activity metrics. The second one has to do with new algorithms we are developing to support the enterprise trend toward the software defined data center.

I am just getting started and looking forward to the challenges ahead. I will provide an update on the patents and stay tuned for more on the Netuitive technology and solution advancements.
