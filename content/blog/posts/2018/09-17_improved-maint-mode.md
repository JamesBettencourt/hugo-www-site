**Things to Remember About Maintenance Mode:**

- Checks and metrics sent by elements in maintenance mode are not evaluated for the attached policies and alerts.
- Behavioral learning on checks and metrics in maintenance mode are suspended to protect the integrity of their expected baseline behaviors.

The latest version of our CLI also supports setting maintenance durations. Don’t have the CLI? Installation is easy, just download the binary related to your OS and follow the steps on our github page.
