Customers from around the world rely on our platform to better understand their AWS bill and save thousands each month. For some, it’s the only tool they need.

We understand that part of saving on cost also means enabling you to reduce the number of expensive, niche tools in your kit. That’s why Metricly continues to expand its features: to better serve the needs of all our customers. And we’re happy to say, our newest report comes directly from your feedback.

The AWS Services Cost Report
With this report you can compare costs over time, grouped by tag or attribute. This enables you to detect changes before the end of a billing period, meaning you’ll be aware of any jumps in spending and have time to reverse them before they start to add up.

Understanding the Report
In the chart below, each pair of bars represents the value associated with a given cost allocation tag key. Each pair could also represent an attribute, such as an Account ID or region.

Dark Blue: Represents a recent period, such as: last day, last 7 days, last Wednesday, or month-to-date.
Light Blue: Represents the preceding corresponding period (for example, the 7 days prior to the last 7 days).
This report shows you the change by tag value, over time, in both visual and tabular format.

How It’s Useful

Catches Mistakes
Increase in costs can be due to simple mistakes, such as selecting the wrong instance size or launching instance types without a corresponding reservation contract. In those cases, time is of the essence to catch the problem early and reverse it before having a bigger surprise at the end of the month.


Provides Transparency
Often, this kind of report is simply required by organizations for purposes of periodic management reporting. The AWS Services Cost report provides more insight to hosting costs (by department, application, account ID, or region) managers need for governance and planning. Having this report available and with dashboards out-of-the-box makes meeting your compliance needs a breeze.
