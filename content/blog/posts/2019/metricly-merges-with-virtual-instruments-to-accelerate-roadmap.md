We are excited to announce that Metricly has merged with Virtual Instruments, a leading global provider of AIOps for hybrid IT infrastructure management.

### What does this mean for you?

To put it briefly, things will be business-as-usual, with our platform, customer success, and support organization operating exactly as before. We will continue to pursue our product roadmap for both the monitoring and cost management features, now with substantial additional engineering, support, and operational resources.

### Who is Virtual Instruments?

Headquartered in San Jose, California, with an impressive list of customers such as PayPal, Bank of America, Geico, AT&T, eTrade, Unilever, and T-Mobile, as well as distribution partners including Dell EMC and Hitachi, and a global sales force, Virtual Instruments is the established industry leader in application-centric infrastructure monitoring offering an AIOps platform to monitor and optimize every IT infrastructure component in your data center and private cloud including storage, network, hypervisor and operating system.

### What does this mean for us?

We benefit from having an impressive global sales force and partner distribution channels carefully assembled by Virtual Instruments over many years. We will also benefit from adding additional engineering resources to accelerate our product roadmap. As a result, we will be able to fulfill the rising market demand for hybrid and multi-cloud management.

### A stronger roadmap

When we started Metricly, our goal was to apply machine learning to infrastructure performance monitoring. With our focus on the public cloud market, we applied our analytics beyond performance data to include capacity and cost metrics to help organizations safely and easily reduce their public cloud spend without sacrificing performance.

This is also Virtual Instruments mission. We could not be any more philosophically aligned in the quest for applying machine learning to availability, performance, capacity and cost management. Over the last few years, we both solved the same problem in the complementary domains of private and public clouds. Together and with more resources, we will satisfy the rising demand for dynamic resource allocation of computing resources across public, private and hybrid clouds.

### Thank you!

We could not have reached this point on our own, and I want to thank each and every one of our users who supported us, advised us and pushed us to develop valuable new features. Our product managers, developers, support engineers, data scientists, and customer success managers are all driven to make cloud performance monitoring and cost reduction easier and safer for our customers. This commitment is stronger than ever for the next chapter of our journey.
