DevOps thought leaders such as John Willis and Gene Kim have published frameworks for how to describe, define and measure the effectiveness of DevOps. Willis proposed a taxonomy to identify certain patterns that characterize DevOps: [Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing, aka CAMS](https://blog.chef.io/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/). Gene Kim has identified three "ways" that define DevOps: [Flow, Feedback, and Learning](http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/).

But something important is missing from these models:  Real-time analytics. Analytics are an essential part of Measurement in CAMS, as well as a foundation for the Feedback and Learning "ways". Real-time analytics for making timely decisions are challenging, but not impossible. How do you crunch one million metrics, and generate that one alarm that matters, when it matters, and with no noise around it?

If you are interested in learning more, or have an opinion you want to share, register and join us at the [DevOpsDC Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DevOpsDC/events/175713492/) on June19 in Reston, Va. where we will look at DevOps and analytics in more detail.
