Development & Operations -- Strange bedfellows shaping the future of business critical applications and services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Much has been written about what DevOps is ... and what it is not. For some, DevOps is about inherently different development and operations folks coming together to collaborate more closely and leverage best practices for managing automation and cloud applications. They covet agility based on continuous integration, accelerating code development, and product releases. They live under a fundamental mantra of "build, test deploy."

For others, DevOps is more about what DevOps is not. They are vocal in their opinions that DevOps is not a "job title," that it is not about solving a particular IT issue or problem, that it is not a software tool, and that it is not just about "continuous integration."

But all agree that DevOps is NOT going away.

And while large and small enterprises are starting to recognize how DevOps is at the heart of transformational changes taking place in product and service delivery, DevOps continues to be ill-defined. Articles and opinions tend to be varied sometimes bordering on convoluted. To learn more, seek out the true DevOps thought leaders.

From Metricly's perspective, it's obvious that automation is at the heart of the DevOps value chain.  What may be less obvious is how intelligent IT [analytics becomes increasingly important ](/forget-devops-devopsbiz)as IT initiatives start to scale beyond the limitations of human interpretation of more heterogeneous environments being monitored. The process breaks down when crucial apps are suddenly not available due to infrastructure and applications problems that cannot be identified. Particularly in large organizations, automation of problem isolation and ease of use are still the most important qualities in tools that solve DevOps problems.
