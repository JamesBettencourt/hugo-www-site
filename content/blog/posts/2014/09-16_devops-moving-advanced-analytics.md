I had the honor of speaking with [Gene Kim](http://www.realgenekim.me/) last week. Gene is co-author (along with Kevin Behr and George Spafford) of the renowned book titled *[The Phoenix Project](http://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/)*, and is one of DevOps' foremost thought leaders.

As Netuitive's Chief Data Scientist, I am increasingly speaking with DevOps leaders interested in learning about advanced analytics solutions, as our company is leveraging a decade of advanced analytics to accelerate delivery of a cloud-based solution to the DevOps community. Gene was gracious enough to discuss strategies for cloud-based analytics and algorithms --- particularly in the AWS environment.

He confirmed that while DevOps leaders continue to be interested in basic monitoring, their interest has evolved in recent months beyond basic alerting to include anomaly detection and behavior learning technologies.

He noted that analytics is now clearly top of mind and cited a noticeable increase in analytics discussions and presentations, especially around entire conferences such as Monitorama 2014. He assessed that more than half of the discussions at this year's event went beyond traditional methods of manual alert configuration, and were focused on approaches to detect anomalies in real-time.

The confirmation from his vantage point helped validate the timing for the launch of our [cloud offering](https://www.metricly.com/product) for DevOps. So for that, we are very appreciative of Gene's time.
