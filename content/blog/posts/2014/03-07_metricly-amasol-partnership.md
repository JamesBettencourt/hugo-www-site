IT Operations Analytics (ITOA) is seeing traction in Germany and the EU.

Munich, Germany-based IT systems integrator and Metricly partner amasol is seeing increased interest in Germany and the EU on the topic of IT Operations Analytics (or ITOA), a term coined by leading industry analyst firm Gartner.  amasol has a white paper available for download on their web site in German entitled ["IT Operations Analytics -- Definition, Implementation Scenarios, Market Overview."](http://www.amasol.de/download/whitepaper-it-operations-analytics.html)

Stefan Deml from amasol also offers is thoughts on the topic in this [interesting article about IT Operations Analytics on Data insider](http://www.datacenter-insider.de/methoden-fuer-end-user-zentriertes-service-performance-management-a-436761/).

All this falls on the heels of a big joint customer win for Metricly and amasol for deploying Metricly's ITOA solution in the travel industry (more details to come).  Highlights from this project will be discussed at amasol's annual customer event on 14-15 May in Dresden, Germany.
