Quickly explore your AWS Bill with our new widget!

1.  Open an existing or create a new dashboard.
2.  Click **+ Add Widget**.
3.  Click **Add** on the Cost Explorer widget card.
4.  Select your preferred **Visualization** and **Time Range**.
5.  Name the widget.
6.  Click **Save**.

## Visualization Options

### Period Comparison

The Period Comparison view enables you to select a current timeframe (day, month, 6 months, etc) and compare its previous time frame interval. For example, the below screenshot shows a **current 6 month period **of *May 16, 2018 -- November 15, 2018 *and a **previous 6 month interval** of *November 16, 2017 -- May 15, 2018***.**

### Service Total

The Service Total view displays a traditional bar graph that contains spend data corresponding with the designated time range.

### Doughnut

The Doughnut view is great for comparing the spend of each service in relation to your overall AWS bill.

### Promoting a Culture of Savings

Metricly believes that a culture built on communication, routine, and best practices is the key to success. Features like our new Cost Explorer widget allow you and your stakeholders to stay proactive against creeping costs by communicating a clear understanding of where your costs are today in relation to the past---without bogging you down with extra work to do.
