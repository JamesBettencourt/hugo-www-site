Netuitive's engineering team finished out 2015 by preparing our service platform for new releases of a number of large features in Q1 2016. We also made several enhancements to the Windows agent, cost reports, and greatly expanding product documentation. Here are the last release highlights of 2015:

Enhanced AWS Cost Savings Reports
---------------------------------

[![December 2015: costReport](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/costReport.jpg)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/costReport.jpg)

We added new capabilities to our AWS cost savings reports which are activated via our existing AWS Cost datasource at no extra charge. The new reports compare utilization against cost resources and allow you to quickly identify over- and under-provisioned resources and the AWS costs associated with them. For example, you can compare your average, maximum, or 95-percentile EC2 CPU utilization over time by type, size, and tag against the fees that you paid to AWS for the same period.

**Coming up next:** Reports that are currently in development will deliver more actionable recommendations to lower your AWS bill by changing the types and sizes of your EC2 instances or by stopping and terminating instances based on usage patterns.

Windows Agent Updates
---------------------

Our open source Windows agent now supports the collection of events available in Windows Event Viewer. The Windows events can be viewed alongside collected events and detected anomalies from other data sources supported by Netuitive. We also added support for Windows metrics in our CPU Usage and Memory Usage widgets that display stacked graphs of key performance indicators and the automated discovery of relationships between EC2s and Windows agents.

API Documentation
-----------------

[![API Documentation (December 2015 New Releases)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/APIDocs.jpg)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/APIDocs.jpg)

Netuitive's API is now accessible to all users. We just released our API documentation to guide users who are interested to take advantage of the wide range of available API calls. You can find the API documentation in the user guide, which is accessible via Netuitive product user interface or directly at [https://help.netuitive.com](https://help.netuitive.com/). Netuitive's API documentation comes complete with the following:

-   Available Method calls
-   Available parameters and headers where applicable
-   Example of requests and responses for each method call

Each parameter is explained in plain English to de-mystify Netuitive's API for newbies, so get in there and let us know how we can improve!

Infrastructure Updates
----------------------

To deliver more exciting features over the next few months, our engineering team made architectural updates to improve performance and usability include:

-   Updates to how we index and query the resources that we monitor for a responsive and consistent user interface throughout our product
-   Creation of new micro-services for continued horizontal scalability
-   Implementation of new API calls to support our upcoming dynamic dashboard feature
-   Setting of the foundation of supporting monitoring configuration packages that allow users to exchange configuration settings on our product platform
-   Multiple any other scalability improvements

We also prepared for a new approach to deliver beta features in 2016 by separating them in our user interface, which allows us to stage features with larger scope for early product feedback.

Happy Holidays
--------------

On behalf of all of our employees, we wish you a happy holiday season, and we look forward to supporting you with our new features in 2016!
