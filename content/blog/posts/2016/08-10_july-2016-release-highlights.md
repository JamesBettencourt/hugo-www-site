Monitoring your environment got your office heating up more than usual? Turn to this month's set of highlights to keep you cool, calm, and collectd (see what we did there?)

Metricly's July 2016 release highlights include Daily Report Improvements, Python-StatsD integration, and policy improvements. Here we go:

Daily Report Improvements
-------------------------

The Daily Report has a new look and feel, contributing to a better user experience overall. Responsiveness of the report has improved, so the Daily Report is now mobile device friendly. The severity level of the alerting policy violations has been added to the report, as well as a day-over-day comparison of the alert volume relative to the prior day. We've also added a *Most Active Policies* section to give better insight into your most frequently triggered policies which complements the existing Top Violating report card by listing the most common performance issues in your environment that has been detected by our behavior learning technology.

Python Integration via StatsD
-----------------------------

As of this past month, we can add Python to Metricly's ever-growing list of supported integrations. All of your Python code can be instrumented with gauges and timers at the class and method call level using open source StatsD agents. Decide where to create key metrics in your most important code blocks, and Metricly's StatsD server picks them up and applies analytics and behavior learning to generate metric charts. These custom metrics can then be monitored using Metricly policies and dashboards. To get started with the Python integration, install the Metricly Linux agent and take a look at the [Python configuration instructions](https://help.netuitive.com/Content/Datasources/Netuitive/python.htm).

Reduce Alarm Noise w/ Policy Improvements
-----------------------------------------

[![policies](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/policies-1024x513.png)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/policies.png)

We have released a number of additional controls for our alerting policies to help you fine tune our preset alerting policies to your liking. As always, you can also create new alerting policies using our policy editor and by selecting a combination of deviations or rules, except that now you can do so with even more options to choose from in our user interface menus. You can now make a custom list of hosts to add to a policy's scope, exclude specific hosts or elements from an alerting policy, or delete past events (generated by a given policy) that you no longer want to see on our Event Explorer page. Our engineering team will continue to add features related to the alerting theme during the month of August, so look for cool new improvements to follow.
