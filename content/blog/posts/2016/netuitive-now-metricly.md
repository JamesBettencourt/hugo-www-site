***A LETTER FROM OUR FOUNDER AND CEO***

Hello,

Iâ€™m excited to announce that Netuitive is now **Metricly**.

This change represents the culmination of efforts that began two years ago, when we decided to apply our years of advanced machine learning expertise to a create a new SaaS offering and extend it to the rapidly-growing market of public cloud computing.

The last step of this launch is to give it a new identity.

By bringing performance, capacity, and cloud cost analysis together, Metricly learns the behavior and workload patterns of your environment to optimize your resource utilization, reduce your cloud spending, and identify performance anomalies that matter to your business.

You can expect the same innovation, commitment, and customer service from our team as we start this new chapter as Metricly.
