Netuitive's Metric Explorer [offers a new way](https://help.netuitive.com/Content/Metrics/metrics_page.htm) to look at the health of your environment as a whole, while retaining the ability to make deep dives into your metrics where necessary. Now [dashboards](https://www.metricly.com/product/dashboards-and-reports) aren't the only way to track your analytics. You can explore your metrics across your entire environment with a few simple clicks -- no dashboard creation required!

This post highlights recent improvements to the Metric Explorer that enhance usability, design, and function:

Quick-Start Monitoring Metrics
------------------------------

We've made radical changes to the way you view metrics in Netuitive with Quick-Start Metrics. The blue boxes below the events graph now pre-populate the filters and render charts for their respective metrics immediately. Each box provides all metrics of that type across your environment -- no more wondering if you've forgotten to add an element to your dashboard! Metrics Explorer simplifies your metrics, helping you find the analytics you need faster.

We've also added an [Events](https://help.netuitive.com/Content/Events/events.htm) graph across the top of the Explorer, giving you immediate insight into possible performance problems. Each event offers the option to view the violating metrics, which makes problem-solving quicker and easier.

Filter by Metric
----------------

New filters allow you to select a metric without having to select specific elements. Compare and contrast the performance of various elements in a single area, as well gaining visibility into the health of that metric across all your elements. See CPU Utilization for all your EC2s:

Or dive into all your Linux disk metrics:

These new filters offer valuable insights, as well as providing a one-stop shop for monitoring each metric.

Metric Grouping
---------------

Once metric charts are displayed, they can be grouped by multiple tags and attributes, making it easier to see and compare metrics.

[![Metric Explorer: Metric Grouping](https://www.metricly.comhttps://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GroupingMetrics-1024x507.png)](https://www.metricly.comhttps://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GroupingMetrics.png)

View the performance of all your application servers, or just those assigned to a particular project or feature. Attribute filtering is also available, so you can see metrics in certain availability zones, or in certain Auto Scale Groups, or any number of attributes.

Our engineering team is hard at work adding even more features to the new Metric Explorer, so stay tuned for more updates. And as always, please feel free to send your feedback.
