***PLEASE NOTE THIS IS AN ARCHIVED POST*** - Netuitive has since become Metricly, and the tool has matured greatly since the time this was written!

As an [analytics pioneer](/), it's been interesting to watch the evolution of the DevOps movement. At the same time, we continue to see the next generation of IT following the best practices of the past when it comes to monitoring. Many DevOps shops seem content with eyeball-driven dashboard monitoring.  Some like Etsy have initiated open source projects to develop and promote more advanced monitoring analytics with [Skyline](https://github.com/etsy/skyline), but it remains a blind spot for most of the industry -- especially in larger, more dynamic environments.

So as we refine our new SaaS-based product we have become very interested in DevOps industry expert opinions and perspective -- particularly as it relates to the role of analytics.

Along the way we have been meeting and learning who the DevOps industry leaders are and thought it might be interesting to share the info with others. Last summer we [posted a blog](/follow-thought-leaders-devops) called Follow the Thought Leaders #DevOps. It was intended to be a resource DevOps interests and the list was sourced primarily based on their social media following.  It featured leaders such as Gene Kim, John Willis, Andrew Clay Shaffer, Jesse Robbins, Patrick DeBois, Jez Humble, John Allspaw, Damon Edwards, and others.

After getting feedback, opinions and suggestions, we decided to extend the original blog. Below is a second installment with a list of additional thought leaders active on social media that we thought you may be interested to follow. While it includes Twitter handles, this list is based on suggestions from some of the thought leaders who were on the list of our original blog.

Check it out and, as always, your opinions (and suggestions for a third installment) are welcome.
