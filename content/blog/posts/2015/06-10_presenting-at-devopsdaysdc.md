I'm getting ready to present at [DevOpsDaysDC](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-washington-dc/) on Friday morning, June 12.  Very exciting!  The title of the talk is "The Fallacy of Analytics" and it's based off a whitepaper we published this year. [You can find a copy here.](/whitepaper-fallacy-real-time-analytics)

As Netuitive's Chief Data Architect, I am a most ardent fan of analytics.  So you might wonder, why would I be talking about fallacy instead of fabulous-ness?

Consider the following metaphor:

We just completed major office construction at Netuitive. We were so excited to get improvements in our layout, d√©cor, and overall ambiance. Then the construction workers arrived and the chaos started. There was dust everywhere and intermittent lapses in power. Finally, when the work was completed, we moved to our new space.  Only then, could we start enjoying the benefits that initially got us excited in the first place.

That's how it is with analytics. You get excited for improvements, but it gets worse before it ultimately becomes great. Ultimately, you need to know what you are doing --- how to direct your efforts to get maximal results without being discouraged by the process.  That's what I'll be talking about.

I look forward to seeing you there!
