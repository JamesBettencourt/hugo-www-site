Here's what we're thankful for this holiday season -- in November, Netuitive delivered more utilization metrics, packages, a Ruby agent, and wild card policies!

Utilization Metrics Update
--------------------------

[![Utilization Metrics Update (November Release)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AdditionalUtilizationMetrics.jpg)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AdditionalUtilizationMetrics.jpg)

Your utilization reports just became a lot more dynamic. Netuitive now includes a host of new utilization metrics for a number of different element types. The Utilization Reports have much more flexibility because now you can select from a larger group of computed metrics.

Pre-Configured Monitoring Packages
----------------------------------

Netuitive now provides easily configured monitoring packages for dashboard, policy, and analytics configuration. There are several new default packages for AWS elements, Windows, Linux, Collectd, and more. You can view available packages as well as install or uninstall packages using the API. When you install a package it provides an ideal Netuitive configuration for select elements, but allows you to modify them as needed. Think of them as quick-start templates to help get you up and running quickly.

Ruby Agent Beta
---------------

Monitoring your Ruby applications has never been easier with Netuitive's Ruby agent. The Ruby agent collects and displays important metrics--such as Response time, throughput, and error rate---in the Netuitive Performance Explorer, similar to how our Java agent collects JVM metrics. Setting up the agent is as easy as deploying the agent in your environment, check out our [help system](https://help.netuitive.com/) for more details.

Wild Card (*) Support for Policies
----------------------------------

[![Wild Card (*) Support for Policies (November Release)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WildCardSupportPolicies.jpg)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com-netuitive-app-usw2-public/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WildCardSupportPolicies.jpg)

Metric names in conditions can now use the wild card (*) for multiple metrics with similar names. This allows you another way to create the scope on a Policy condition. Using the wild card or simplified names is as easy as selecting the Includes/Regex radio button on the condition card in the Policy Editor.
