We are very excited about the launch of our new Netuitive SaaS product. Our Development Team has already added many features for your benefit this February! Several new releases are highlighted below like customizable metric and event charts, specialized widgets, and more integrations.

Customizable metric charts and event graphs
-------------------------------------------

The performance explorer now allows you to see your metrics and event data in customizable chart form. Metric charts detail the position of metrics alongside their contextual and baseline bands (if available). Events graphs display the triggered events (based on policies) for the selected metrics and time frame along a timeline.

To access, select an element and then select as many metrics as desired to begin seeing your data and events.

Specialized widgets
-------------------

[![Dashboard Views](https://www.metricly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dashboardView1-1024x778.png)](https://www.metricly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dashboardView1.png)

Time Series widgets that graph individual metrics for a single element over a certain time period are now available on the Netuitive dashboard.

The dashboard contains default widgets, but you are also able to create your own widgets that monitor data specific to you. Widgets can show any individual metric, from surge queue length data of an ELB to volume write bytes of an EBS.

Collectd integration
--------------------

Collectd is a daemon which collects system performance statistics periodically and provides mechanisms to store the values in a variety of ways. Integrate collectd metrics into Netuitive with a few lines of code in your configuration file. One of our engineers completed the process in 5 minutes. Collectd gathers unique metrics such as zombie process count and interface errors that expand Netuitive's ability to collect all types of data.

Diamond integration
-------------------

[![Diamond Data Source (New Releases)](https://www.metricly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/diamondDataSource.jpg)](https://www.metricly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/diamondDataSource.jpg)

Diamond is a python daemon that collects system metrics and publishes them to a monitoring tool like Netuitive. It is capable of collecting cpu, memory, network, i/o, load and disk metrics, plus many other metrics.

Also this agent features a powerful API for collecting metrics from almost any source. More specifically, Diamond collects metrics on network interface that are not collected by AWS or collectd that could be used to create a policy to monitor network activity.
